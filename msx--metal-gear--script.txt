Metal Gear (MSX, UK Version) Script
by Nekura_Hoka 6/4/2004, Ver. 1.2 (10/3/04)
______________________________________________________________________________

-Updated in Version 1.2
     Corrected some byte/bit values in describing the 'wordvar' system.
    Stupid me, I made some major miscalculations.
     Also enhanced the intro with info about the differing number of
    messages in the Japanese vs. UK versions.
     Enhanced the explanation of the script code annotations.

-Updated in Version 1.1
     Replaced "[" character with "?". An error on my part, its the only
    appearance of a question mark in the game's script.
     Also cleaned up the formatting. I removed some extra spaces in the
    text that resulted from the replacement process. Script is now
    cleaner and easier to read all around.

=================
= 1. Introduction
=================

 Here is a proper dump of the script in Metal Gear for the MSX. This is the
script from the UK version. The script is a literal decoding from the
UK version with no typo corrections. Any typo shown is actually what
occurred in the game. The text in the script is not necessarily
chronologically accurate since the script in the game was not arranged that
way. Although I will say that it is essentially in chronological order.

 It should also be noted that the UK version features an english
translation that eliminated 69 of the original 155 messages in the Japanese
version. The missing messages are some comedic messages and ones concerning
the pickup and Big Boss' description of items. Incidentally there are also
4 messages which are in the Japanese version which are disabled and not
present in the script area. Its pure speculation, but they were probably
more item descriptions for things like the Oxygen Tank etc. which aren't
described by Big Boss in the final Japanese game.

 It took some work to complete this script since the text in the game was
code-referenced rather than simply a literal string of text. What I mean is
they would have hex values representing a block of text in many places to
save space. For instance, the words "BIG BOSS" show up in several
places in the script. Rather than having "BIG BOSS" spelled out each time
it is intended to appear (thereby taking up useful data space), they
assigned it the hex value of a1. Each time "a1" (8 bits) would show
up in the code it would be replaced by the game program with "BIG BOSS" (64
bits). Thusly, since "BIG BOSS" shows up 19 times in the code they ended
up needing only 408 bits of code (including the reference after the script
to define what the hex value is to be replaced with) for what would have
normally required 1,216 bits.

 Feel free to download, host, and use the contents of this as you please,
but please give credit for the extraction to me. Thanks and enjoy!

============
= 3. Lexicon
============

 There are certain bytes in the script code which were used to instruct the
game program what to do at that point in the text. For the purposes of
understanding what these instructions essentially were, I replaced them with
a basic word description to understand what was going on. Here is what they
mean:

"begin_message"         = Beginning of an onscreen message. The script
                  is formatted so that this initial byte
                  tells the game what type of message box to
                  use. (ie timed or prompted and size)

"end_message"           = Just what it says. This is a byte that tells
                  the game program to end the message.

"keyprompt"         = In a transceiver message this is where a
                  byte would tell the program to wait for the
                  player to press a button to advance the
                  message text. In the end credits for the
                  game and some other special messages this
                  indicates when a timed pause should occur
                  between the current and next page of text.
